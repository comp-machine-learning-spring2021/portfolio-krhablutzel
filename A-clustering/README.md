# Building Seasons for North Carolina
### Unsupervised Learning with k-Means Clustering

Here in North Carolina, we often joke that we have [twelve](https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/fuw1bo/the_12_season_of_north_carolina/) [seasons](https://twitter.com/durhamnc/status/1217887940417814529?lang=en) of [weather](https://twitter.com/durhamnc/status/1302644512951619584?lang=en), usually listed as:

- Winter
- Fool’s Spring
- Second Winter
- Spring of Deception
- Third Winter
- The Pollening
- Actual Spring
- Summer
- Hell’s Front Porch
- False Fall
- Second Summer
- Actual Fall

These descriptions subjectively seem to fit our weather more accurately than the traditional Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, but twelve is an oddly specific number. After learning about clustering algorithms, I started wondering, *what is the optimal number of clusters to describe North Carolina's weather?*

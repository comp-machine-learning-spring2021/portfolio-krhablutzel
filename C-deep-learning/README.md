explaining the coding element (think something similar to a short project write-up)

when was looking at seasons, noticied it seems to be humid ALL  THE TIME - humid days don't mean it's going to rain. build nn to predict whether it rains tomorrow from today's weather

build RNN to predict rain pattern over time

# Kathleen Hablutzel's Machine Learning Portfolio
### CSC 294 Computational Machine Learning
### Spring 2021

A readme file that both introduces you and synthesizes the elements of the portfolio in a cohesive manner. Your readme should include a brief introduction about you (perhaps in the style of a resume or short cover letter) as well as highlight the following: 
- The skills and expertise you have in machine learning
- The depth of your knowledge in the field
- Your interests beyond machine learning 

Hello and welcome to my machine learning portfolio! I'm wrapping up my sophomore year with a portfolio to showcase the skills I've picked up in my machine learning course this semester. In this porfolio, I've chosen to highlight _____, but we covered many foundational techniques this semester, including SVD/PCA, Gradient Descent, SVM, Random Forest Classifiers, kNN, k-Means, and deep learning. I've enjoyed taking a deep dive into each of these techniques, both applying them with `sklearn` and implementing many of them in Python from scratch!

As a Computer Science + Statistical and Data Sciences double major and Zollman Scholar at Smith College, I hope to continue applying many of these techniques in my future endeavors. I currently work as a software engineer in the Grubb Lab through the STRIDE research program, and I'm an incoming data engineer at Bank of America for Summer 2021. I'm excited to have all these machine learning techniques in my toolkit! Outside machine learning, my interests include data science, networks, complex systems, and cryptography.
